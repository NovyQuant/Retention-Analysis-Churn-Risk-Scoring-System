Project: Retention Analysis and Churn Prediction in E-commerce Developed a machine learning model (Random Forest) to identify customers at risk of churning.

Innovation: Replaced rigid Churn definitions (e.g., 90 days) with a dynamic threshold based on individual customer Inter-Purchase Time.

Feature Engineering: Engineered variables describing trend dynamics (activity increase/decrease) and behavioral indicators (RFM, returns, basket diversity).

Result: Achieved an F1-Score of 93%. The project culminated in a financial report estimating the annualized value of revenue at risk (LTV modeling) and segmenting the customer base into risk groups.

Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas.

Models:
1. Logistic Regression (Baseline)
2. Decision Tree/KNN
3. Random Forest
